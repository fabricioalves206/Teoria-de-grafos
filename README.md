**Graph theory coding in c/c++**
In this application, you must to insert an adjacency matrix or an incidence matrix. Each methode will need a type of matrix that is indicated between parenthesis. After that, you have to choose a methode of the theory that will make the following procedures :

+ Case 1: checks if the graph is regular (adjacency matrix)
+ Case 2: checks if the graph is k-regular (incidence matrix)
+ Case 3: checks if the graph is eulerian (adjacency matrix)
+ Case 4: checks if the graph is eulerian (incidence matrix)
+ Case 5: calculates the number of connected components existing in a simple graph (adjacency matrix)
+ Case 6: calculates the number of connected components existing in a simple graph (incidence matrix)
+ Case 7: checks if the graph is complete (adjacency matrix)
+ Case 8: finds the complement of a graph (adjacency matrix)
+ Case 9: checks if a simple graph is bipartite (adjacency matrix)
+ Case 10: calculates the reachability matrix (incidence matrix)
